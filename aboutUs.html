		<p class="OurPhilosophys">Maximize the look and feel of Your Home</p>
		<p class="Philosophy">Bella Design and Staging’s goal is to inspire our clients everyday moments by creating a thematic inspiration and timeless personal space. Our designers re-imagine a space that allows prospective buyers to visualize and connect with a homes’ potential beauty.</p><p class="Philosophy">We assist Realtors and homeowners in Marin and Southern Sonoma Counties in achieving a high level design with flawless execution and impeccable service.</p><p class="Philosophy">Bella Design and Staging has high quality contemporary furnishings and various accents to get your home market ready.  By staging a home it opens up prospective buyer’s minds to visually see themselves in your home.</p><p class="Philosophy">Studies conducted by the National Association of Realtors reveals that only ten percent of buyers visualize the potential of a home that is not staged and that leaving a home “as is” actually helps the competition.  Research has also proven that home staging has brought in an <span>average of 8-10% higher sales prices</span> and helps cut the average days the home is on the market.  Staged homes look better than the competition and cost much less than your first price reduction.</p>
